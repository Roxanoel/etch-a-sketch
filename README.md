# etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-sketch project, an assignment for The Odin Project.

Features to add:
- Button that simply resets the current grid.
- Colour picker.
- Slider to choose new grid size (prevents needing to check that
 the value entered by the user is valid).
 - Eraser tool (makes each cell "uncoloured" upon hovering).
